- Top N sectors visualization (bar charts and pie charts)
- Time series comparison across sectors
- Interactive sector selection

### 🔬 Micro Analysis (Detailed Level)
- Drill-down into specific sectors
- Sub-category breakdowns
- Detailed statistics and raw data views
- Granular exploration of individual sectors

### ⚖️ Comparative Analysis
- Side-by-side comparison of GHG and CO2 emissions
- Correlation analysis
- Cross-dataset insights

### ⚡ RTE Energy Analysis
- **Peak & Down Timing Analysis**:
  - Hourly patterns to identify peak consumption/production times
  - Day of week patterns
  - Monthly patterns with peak identification
  - Time series with peak and low periods highlighted
- **Production by Sector**:
  - Total production breakdown by sector
  - Interactive sector comparison
  - Time series analysis per sector
  - Sector summary statistics
- **Energy Consumption Analysis**:
  - Daily consumption patterns
  - Peak demand identification
  - Consumption trends over time

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using the project configuration:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run sncf.py
```

Or use the provided script:

```bash
./run_app.sh
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Data

The application uses data from the `data/` folder:

### SNCF Data (in `data/sncf/`):
- `bilans-des-emissions-de-gaz-a-effet-de-serre-sncf.parquet` - Greenhouse gas emissions balance
- `emission-co2-perimetre-complet.parquet` - CO2 emissions complete perimeter

### RTE Data (in `data/rte/`):
- `Historique_consommation_JOUR_2023.xls` - Daily energy consumption history
- `RealisationDonneesProduction_2023.xls` - Energy production data by sector

## Navigation
